# #In this code we are going to use some of the built in functions 
# #1)
# print("we are using some of the built in functions ")# we use print for display of a statement or some other code 

# # 2
# input("please enter some data") #we use input for input  of data 
# #now if we want to print the value of input 
# name=input("please Enter your Name")
# print("your name is ", name )

# #3) for finding the length of the string 
# text = "Hello, World!"
# length = len(text) 
# print(length)
# # now it will print 13 because space also counts in length 

# #4) absoulute value 
# absoulute_of_number=abs(-5)
# print(absoulute_of_number)

# there are many other built in funtions we can use them like 
My_REcord=[1,2,39,5,7,3,]
My_Sorted_Record=sorted(My_REcord)
print(My_Sorted_Record) # it will print this [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 39]
