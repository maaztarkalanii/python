#in this programm we are going to be work with some of the variable and data types 
#Data types in programming represent the kind of data that a variable can hold.
# Data types determine what operations can be performed on the data,
# how much memory is allocated to store the data, and how the data is represented internally. 

a =10
b=20
sum = a+b
print(sum)
# this is how we can use a int value in python
# now it will return a int value 30 

a =10.5
b=20.6
sum = a+b
print(sum)
# here we can see this clearly that we can save two variables with same name but different data types 

# now we are moving toward strings
name = "Maaz Ali"
print(name)
